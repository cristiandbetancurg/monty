# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Learning Objectives

General

- What do LIFO and FIFO mean
- What is a stack, and when to use it
- What is a queue, and when to use it
- What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
- What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
- What is the proper way to use global variables
- How to work with git submodules

## Requirements

- All files are created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS on gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All files are linted for syntax and style with [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty)

```c
/**
 * struct stack_s - doubly linked list representation of a stack (or queue)
 * @n: integer
 * @prev: points to the previous element of the stack (or queue)
 * @next: points to the next element of the stack (or queue)
 *
 * Description: doubly linked list node structure
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO Holberton project
 */
typedef struct stack_s
{
        int n;
        struct stack_s *prev;
        struct stack_s *next;
} stack_t;
```

```c
/**
 * struct instruction_s - opcode and its function
 * @opcode: the opcode
 * @f: function to handle the opcode
 *
 * Description: opcode and its function
 * for stack, queues, LIFO, FIFO Holberton project
 */
typedef struct instruction_s
{
        char *opcode;
        void (*f)(stack_t **stack, unsigned int line_number);
} instruction_t;
```

## The Monty language

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty byte code files

Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

```sh
julien@ubuntu:~/0x19-stacks_queues_lifo_fifo$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
push 4$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
pall$
julien@ubuntu:~/0x19-stacks_queues_lifo_fifo$
```
